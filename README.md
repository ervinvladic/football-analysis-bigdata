# football-analysis-bigdata

## Description
- The project presents an analysis of the English Premier League in the 2021/2022 season, using Hadoop and MapReduce. The dataset contains information about 380 matches, including match statistics, results, and various match-related features. The most important data were extracted, such as the average number of shots, the number of shots on goal, yellow and red cards, the ratio of results at halftime and at the end, the average number of goals scored and conceded per game.
  
- The project was done as a part of the **CEN 569 309 Big Data Technologies** course at the Master Study of Data Science at International Burch University.
